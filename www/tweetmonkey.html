                        <p>Tweet Monkey is a hilariously simple maker project.</p>
                        <p>I find that most maker projects online are intended to flex the muscles of a given maker or technology and end up being rather complicated and difficult to replicate. Tweet Monkey is my attempt to create a project that cross a number of maker disciplines while remaining conceptually simple. It's easy to acquire the needed materials, and hopefully when you've built a Tweet Monkey, you'll have a good grasp on a number of concepts.</p>
                        <p>Tweet Monkey monitors Twitter for tweets that contain the hashtag #tweetmonkey. When someone (anyone in the world) tweets with #tweetmonkey, then your Tweet Monkey will respond by animating (clanging his symbols, nodding his head, and squawking) for a couple of seconds. It takes advantage of Node.js which makes accessing Twitter a breeze. It's designed such that the work of looking for tweets is offloaded to Twitter - afterall, they know quite well how to search for tweets and they have a few servers to do the work. Tweet Monkey just hangs out waiting for Twitter to push down notification.</p>
                        <p>The entirety of the code for Tweet Monkey easily fits on a single page. It's very short. I like short code that expresses the essence of what I'm trying to do.</p>

You would be better off on many  of these components to buy them in bulk to keep your cost low. For some items, it's difficult to buy a small enough quantity to complete a single project. I think you should go ahead and stock up and use the extras for new maker projects!</p>

                        <h5>Modify the Monkey</h5>
                        <p>This monkey comes out of the box ready to entertain the masses with a simple on/off switch on his... uh... underside. That sort of monkey business isn't enough for us though! We want to control it programmatically. Because... makers!</p>
                        <p>So the first thing we need to do is inspect our monkey's downstairs and see how the switch works.</p>
                        <p>Here's what we see...</p>
                        <p><img alt="Monkey switch" src="images/tweetmonkey/switch.png" /></p>
                        <p>If you've chosen to control something other than this monkey, what you're looking for is any means of tapping into the primary circuit. You want to be able to complete the circuit with logic... programmatically. If your device doesn't do its thing simply by being switched on (like it has a "go" button of some kind) then that's going to be different, and is outside the scope of this project tutorial. It's not impossible or even often all that difficult though, so take heart.</p>
                        <p>We're dealing with a complete circuit here. There are two AA (1.5V) batteries and they're hooked up in serial, so that means that this monkey runs on 3V and some unknown amount of current will be drawn when the circuit is complete. I've taken this toy apart and happen to know that at its heart it's a simple DC motor that's attached mechanically to all of the squawking, clanging, and nodding.</p>
                        <p>You don't often know how much current any given <em>load</em> is going to require. You could put meters in the circuit and measure, but the better thing to do is to simply leave a circuit as is with it's own power source and everything.</p>
                        <p>The thing you have to be careful about is attempting to "drive" your circuit with the current from your microprocessor, because microprocessors tend to cost real money and also tend to not be capable of providing a ton of current before they go bye bye.</p>
                        <p>Ironically, though, the boards we're dealing with - these amazing works of engineering - are only 2-3 times the price of this silly mechanical monkey! The inner workings of computers are child's play compared to the inner workings of our global economy. But I digress. My point was that you don't want to toast your board.</p>
                        <p>So we want to control the monkey by simply doing the equivalent of turning the switch on an off.</p>
                        <p>What we discover in this monkey's underside is that the switch on the outside of the trapdoor is simply connecting or disconnecting the ends of the batteries and completing or breaking the circuit. So let's do the same. Let's simply tap into the two contacts with some wires, run them out, and use software to virtually touch the ends of the wire together.</p>
                        <p>There are two ways to accomplish this. If you don't mind a little drilling and soldering, you can run wires through the battery door and solder them to the metal contacts. This is a good solution if you're comfortable with it. If you'd rather avoid the extra work, read on.</p>
                        <p>We need to run wires outside all clean like, so let's drill some very small holes through the trap door and run wires through. Then we'll set up a soldering station and solder the wires directly to the contacts.</p>
                        <p><img alt="" src="images/tweetmonkey/holes.png" /></p>
                        <p>Now we can close the door and we've got two wires that when touched together complete the circuit and set the monkey in motion. Conveniently, we have not disabled our on/off switch, so if we wish to use it to turn the monkey on, we can still do that.</p>
                        <p>To avoid drilling and soldering, simply use a little bit of electrical tape to attach wires to the ends of the batteries. The black wire to the battery that's showing its negative end, and the red wire to the battery that's showing its positive end. Then carefully close the wires in the door (it will fit though very snugly) and lock it.</p>
                        <p><img height="500" width="500" alt="" src="images/electrictape.jpg" /></p>
                        <p>And just like that, we're done with surgery. Your monkey should recover nicely.</p>

                        <h5>Complete the Circuit</h5>
                        <p>The complete diagram or Tweet Monkey is as follows...</p>
                        <a href="images/tweetmonkey/breadboard-diagram.png"><img alt="Breadboard Diagram" src="images/tweetmonkey/breadboard-diagram-700.png" /></a>
                        <p>You can click that image to make it bigger.</p>
                        <p>This is a very basic circuit. It involves a <a href="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transistor/tran_6.html">MOSFET</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">LED</a>, and three <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/resistors">resistors</a>. I think I've figured out the optimal breadboard layout - one that requires the fewest jumpers and makes the most sense visually.</p>
                        <p>Your resistor values are important, so be sure to match the colored stripes. The direction you insert the resistors (we call that the polarity) is not important. The direction of the MOSFET and the LED, on the other hand, <i>are</i> important. The MOSFET should have the tab in the back and the lettering in the front. The LED should have a long leg and a short one. The long one is what we call the anode. That always goes on the positive side. In this circuit layout it's on the right.</p>

                        <h5>Install and Configure Raspbian on Your Pi</h5>
                        <p>In this guide, we'll be using Raspbian. Raspbian is a version (a "distribution" actually) of Linux. It's a Raspberry Pi specific version of Linux that's based on Debian. This is just one operating system that you can put on Raspberry Pi. In the future, I'll include a guide for installing Windows 10 IoT Core on your device as well.</p>
                        <p>This part pretty much requires that you have an HDMI monitor plugged in to your Pi with at least a keyboard - if not a mouse. If you don't have those, then you'll need to plug your Pi in to an ethernet cable and remote to it using it's mDNS name (which by default is raspberrypi.local).</p>
                        <p>Go to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian</a> and download the zip file for the latest version of Raspbian (currently Jessie as of this writing).</p>
                        <p>Put your microSD card into an adapter and then into your computer.</p>
                        <p>Follow the installation guide <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md">here</a> to get the image flashed to your SD card.</p>
                        <p>When the flash is finished, eject the card from your computer and insert it into the microSD card slot on your Raspberry Pi (while the power is off) and then power the Pi on.</p>
                        <p>You should be booted into X - the graphical user interface for Raspbian.</p>
                        <p>Go to Start | Accessories | Terminal and type <code>sudo raspi-config</code> and hit enter.</p>
                        <p>In the Raspbian config interface select Boot Options and configure your device to boot to the command line and prompt for a user login</p>
                        <p>Now reboot your device by typing <code>reboot</code> at the terminal.</p>
                        <p>Now you'll boot to the command line and be prompted to log in</p>
                        <p>Enter <code>pi</code> for the login and <code>raspberry</code> for the password.</p>
                        <p>Set the password for the root user to something you'll remember using <code>sudo passwd root</code> and then entering your password.</p>
                        <p>Now sign in as the root user by typing <code>su root</code>.
                        <p>Now go back to <code>raspi-config</code> (you don't need <code>sudo raspi-config</code> now because you're logged in as the root user).
                        <p style="color:goldenrod;">{ change config options }</p>
                        <p>Now we need to set up your wifi adapter and connect to your wireless network.</p>
                        <p>Type <code>nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code> and add the following to the end of the file...</p>
                            <code>
                                network={<br/>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;ssid=""<br/>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;password=""<br/>
                                }
                            </code>
                        <p>Of course, you need to enter your actual WiFi SSID and password into there.</p>
                        <p>One last thing. You need to configure Raspbian to allow the root user to SSH to the device. You do this by typing <code>nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, locating the line that says <code>PermitRootLogin without-password</code> and adding a <code>#</code> before it to comment it out.</p>

                        <p>You can see all of the available versions of Node.js at <a href="http://nodejs.org/dist">nodejs.org/dist</a> and notice if you click on <a href="http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.26/">version 0.10.26</a> that you see a tarball specifically for the Pi. That's because normally the V8 engine that is behind Node.js isn't compatible with ARM processors. There are certain versions of Node.js that have a compatible build, however. And if I'm not mistaken, the latest versions of Node.js (based on the io.js codebase) are ARM compatible. I need to test that out.</p>

                        <p>Before you can use Twitter programmatically, you have to have a Twitter account, you have to register your app (this project), and you have to get some keys so that you're using the API as <i>you</i>.</p>
                        <p>It's not difficult and it doesn't take long.</p>
                        <p>First, you sign in to Twitter. If you don't have an account already, you need to create one. For the sake of brevity, I'll assume you've got that part.</p>
                        <p>Next, go to apps.twitter.com and click Create New App.</p>
                        <p>Give your app a unique name. It has to be globally unique and the obvious ones may already be taken, so you might want to prefix it with your initials or something.</p>
                        <p>You may not have a website, so you can just make something up for that slot. Make sure it looks like a URL. You can leave the Callback URL blank.</p>
                        <p>Now click the link that says "manage keys and access tokens". Then scroll down and click "Create my access token".</p>
                        <p>You should now be able to see your Consumer Key (API Key), your Consumer Secret (API Secret), your Access Token, and Access Token Secret.</p>

                        <h5>Write the Code</h5>
                        <p>Actually, you're mostly going to download and then configure your code. It's all written for you.</p>
                        <p>The GitHub repository for the entire Tweet Monkey project is at <a href="http://github.com/codefoster/tweetmonkey">github.com/codefoster/tweetmonkey</a>. That repository uses submodules to link in the Raspbian specific project code which is under its own repository at <a href="http://github.com/codefoster/tweetmonkey-raspi">github.com/codefoster/tweetmonkey-raspi</a>. You can either choose to clone the entire Tweet Monkey project or you can just grab the Raspbian code.</p>
                        <p>To clone the Raspbian code only, do this...</p>
                        <p>1. Make sure git works at your console by opening a console window and typing 'git'.</p>
                        <p>2. Change to whatever directory you use for storing your repositories (mine is c:\code).</p>
                        <p>3. Clone the repository by executing 'git clone https://github.com/codefoster/tweetmonkey-raspi.git'</p>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Now you have the code. There's really only one thing you need to do and that is edit the config.js file.</p>
                        <p>You can use whatever text editor you want for editing JavaScript, but I like Visual Studio Code and that's what I'll be showing here.</p>
                        <p>You can download Code for Windows, Mac, or Linux and it's free, so no excuses there. Go to <a href="http://visualstudio.com">visualstudio.com</a></p>
                        <img alt="Visual Studio Code" src="images/tweetmonkey/vs-code.png"/>
                        <p>To open your code in Visual Studio Code, you simply change to the tweetmonkey-raspi directory that was created when you cloned the project and type 'code .'. That opens the current directory in Code. </p>
                        <p>Now we need to transfer the code onto the raspberry pi. We need to use scp to transfer the files on to the pi. Be sure you are in the tweetmonkey-raspi folder. </p>
                        <p>To SCP, use... </p>
                        <p><code> scp  index.js config.js package.json root@192.168.1.13</code>

                        <p>We're going to be writing JavaScript in a Node.js project on this Intel Edison to get this monkey grooving. If you are pulling an Edison out of the box and need help setting it up, have a look at <a href="codefoster.com/edison-setup">codefoster.com/edison-setup</a>. For the rest of this article, you'll need your device to be all configured and on the same wifi network as your host PC (the one you're using Visual Studio on) and you'll need to know the IP address and the login password.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you haven't already, go to <a href="visualstudio.copm">visualstudio.com</a> and download and install Visual Studio Community 2015. Then go to <a href="http://nodejstools.codeplex.com">http://nodejstools.codeplex.com</a> and download and install the Node.js Tools for Visual Studio.</p>
                        
                        <p>Now clone <a href="https://github.com/codefoster/tweetmonkey.git">https://github.com/codefoster/tweetmonkey.git</a> and open the <em>tweetmonkey.njsproj</em> file in Visual Studio. Let me point out a few things about this project.</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>There's a config.js file that you need to fill in with your particulars.</li>
                            <li>Go to <a href="apps.twitter.com">apps.twitter.com</a> and create a new app to get the Twitter API keys and secrets.</li>
                            <li>There's a gulpfile.js that has a deployment project. The IP address and password you enter into the config.js will determine where this project gets deployed.</li>
                            <li>There's a <code>{ track: '#cfmonkey' }</code> in the app.js that you need to change the value of. This is&nbsp;what the search is going to look for.&nbsp;This is not looking for tweets <em>from a user</em> actually, but rather looking for tweets with&nbsp;certain text in the body. I will try to update the GitHub&nbsp;repo with comments for how to search for tweets to a certain user.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>The code in the app.js is hooking into Twitter's &quot;streaming API&quot;. This means that you don't have to poll the service every second to see if any relevant tweets have landed yet. Rather, Twitter will look for them and when one does land, it will call the your code's function. That's a thing of beauty!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="raspi">
                        <h5>Deploy and Run the App</h5>
                        <p>So next we are going SSH to the device and run it.</p>
                        <p>To SSH, use...</p>
                        <p><code>ssh root@192.168.1.13</code> (or whatever your IP address happens to be)</p>
                        <p>Once on the device, cd to the project directory (it should be in the default location depicted by the ~ in the prompt - this is likely /home/root) and then use...</p>
                        <p><code>node app.js</code></p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li class="edison">
                        <h5>Deploy and Run the App</h5>
                        <p>Ideally, I'd have another gulp task for executing the Node.js project on the device, but I haven't quite figured that out yet, so I just SSH to the device and run it.</p>
                        <p>I'll assume you're all set up for using SSH since you've supposedly gone through my <a href="http://codefoster.com/edison-setup">http://codefoster.com/edison-setup</a> article already.</p>
                        <p>To SSH, use...</p>
                        <p><code>ssh root@192.168.1.13</code> (or whatever your IP address happens to be)</p>
                        <p>Once on the device, cd to the project directory (it should be in the default location depicted by the ~ in the prompt - this is likely /home/root) and then use...</p>
                        <p><code>node app.js</code></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                

                
                <!-- Conclusion -->
                <p>So there you have it - a simple, end-to-end tweet monkey! Just what everyone needs.</p>

                <p>I hope you had fun with the monkey specifically, but more importantly, I hope you're just a little bit more comfortable hooking into an existing electronic circuit and using logic from a program you wrote to manipulate it. When you get the concepts behind the procedures, you really start to see the possibilities, and <em>that </em>is the heart of the maker movement.</p>
